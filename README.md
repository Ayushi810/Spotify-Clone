# Spotify-Clone
As part of learning to code,I completed a project that involved creating a basic Spotify clone using HTML, CSS. This project was designed to showcase my skills in front-end web development.It is a responsive and user-friendly web application that allows users to play music.I used HTML and CSS to design and style the interface .I also gained experience working with version control tools such as Git and GitHub.

# Usage-
Once the Spotify clone is open in your browser, You can then click the play button next to the song to start playing it, and use the playback controls at the bottom of the page to control the song playback.The currently playing song and album artwork are displayed in the "Now Playing" section at the bottom of the page.
